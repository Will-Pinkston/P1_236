I think we should be really sneaky and come up with a code when we talk with each other in public. #cutest couple ever! everyone will be like, "wow I wish we were that cute!" It will make our lives like 10x better, don'tcha think?
Okay, so our code:
Instead of calling each other by our actual names, from here on out I will refer to you as #|#sherlock and you will refer to me as #watson|# It will be the best ever, don't you agree #sherlock. 
When ever we refer to our home it will be the tree. It seems mysterious! Then when people ask where we live we can say our tree is on the top of the mountain near the 'Y' Ya' feel me bro? I mean #sherlock.
When we refer to school it will be called *playtime and when we refer to work it will be *nap time. Then I can say, "man my day was hard, I spent 7 hours at *nap time but only got paid for 5 hours." and you can say, "man, *play time was hard, and I have a lot of homework. Dang play time."
When we refer to our cars they will be called the eagle and the mouse. just to keep it fun, the Corolla will be the "eagle" and the Pathfinder will be the "mouse." For example:
Wow, that eagle sure gets great gas milage. It just glides down the road like a breeze. It's great. I really love how smooth it feels. It's perfect. 
Dang, that mouse just chugs along so slow. I think it's tired and ready to die. The accelerator and the heat sure are being weird.

Is this all making sense #sherlock?

When we talk about bed time we will call it 'fighting crime' then we can tell people, "yeah, we didn't 'fight crime' until 2 o'clock in the morning. I'm WAY tired now." They'll be like, "Wow, you are like a #superhero!" then they will go and tell all their friends, "I was just talking with #sherlock and #watson and they said, quote, "'we didn't 'fight crime' until 2 o'clock in the morning.' Crazy, right?"

I think we are really on to something and I think this will really work. I love you #sherlock!

Love always,
#watson
